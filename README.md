# BusyBoxPortable
BusyBox for Windows packaged in PortableApp.com's format.

This repository can be used to generate an installer for [Ron Yorston's port of BusyBox](https://frippery.org/busybox/). Because this installer downloads their pre-compiled binaries, this installer may stop working at any time.

## Building the Installer
* Clone this repository
* Run [PortableApps.com launcher](https://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_launcher) and select the `Base` directory of your local repository.
* Run [PortableApps.com Installer](https://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_installer) and select the `Base` directory of your local repository.
The installer should now be in the root directory of your local repository.
